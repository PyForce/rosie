# rOSi
Extensible robot control application

## Settings
A file named `config` in the application root will be readed for application configuration and module loading.

Here's an example of how this file looks like:

```cfg
[general]
profile = simubot

[ordex]
active = True

[WebHUD]
active = True
```
